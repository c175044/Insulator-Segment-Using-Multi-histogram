# Insulator Extraction from UAV LiDAR Point Cloud Based on Multi-Type and Multi-Scale Feature Histogram

This repository contains the official implementation for the paper:  
**"Chen, M.; Li, J.; Pan, J.; Ji, C.; Ma, W. Insulator Extraction from UAV LiDAR Point Cloud Based on Multi-Type and Multi-Scale Feature Histogram. Drones 2024, 8, 241."**‚Äã

## üìù Overview
A novel method for automated insulator extraction from UAV LiDAR point clouds using:
- ‚Äã**5 Feature Histograms**: HD/HV/HW/VW/VV
- ‚Äã**Multi-Scale Adaptive Grids**
- ‚Äã**Tower-Type Specific Processing**
- ‚Äã**2-Stage Workflow**: Pylon/PL refinement + Insulator extraction

Achieves 100% object accuracy for suspension towers and 97.3% for tension towers with <2s processing per tower.

## üõ† Installation
